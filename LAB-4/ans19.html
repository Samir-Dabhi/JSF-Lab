<!-- 19.	Write a javascript that handles following mouse events.  Add necessary elements
javaScript gives the key code for the key pressed. If the key pressed is 
"a","e","I","o","u" the script should announce that vowel is pressed. 
If the keypressed is alphabet (apart from aeiou) then alphabet is pressed. 
If the keypressed is in between 0-9 then number is pressed and in any other 
case display a message special symbol is pressed. -->
